# Java-ball-breaker-game

PROJECT TITLE: Tetris Puyo

Problem and Solution Abstract:
Our game is using simple concepts of java .WE pick four images that are smilies in this case and we have to pile them or arrange them in such a formation so that four or more in consecutive arrangements is formed that Is known as Tetris. 
If we arrange them in such a way that a Tetris is formed we successfully remove
The piled smilies and can moved all smilies that were in upper position than removed smilies to fill empty space. We have 19 level and each level difficulty I increased by increasing speed of coming smiley.
New Learnings:
We worked together for this project and we researched a lot on new things that we learn from sources of
	YouTube (Especially from Drake banes).
	Different forums (Mostly Oracle help forum for java and GUI).
	Class Mates and Our own Book Java How to Program by Dietel and Dietel 10thEdition.



Some new major learnings are as follow
	Link listing simple list generating for holding references of current position and previous position for comparison of references.
	Timer and delay Handling Making and linking of connection with help of timer class. We learned how to successfully invoke action listener and record a certain task for that delay.
	Java applet for adding small clips of sounds by help of URL and linking address of clip.
	MalformedURLException Handling to complete and skip process of adding    URLS using net class.


How to run this project?
We are uploading a complete project folder Named “End Semester Project”.
Here are some notes how to run this project.
1.	Just drag and paste three .java files in NetBeans or include them.
2.	Make sure you do not change name of any folder.
3.	We have two folders of sound and images don’t change name of single file single sound clip or single image as they will not be loaded in program if name is changed.
4.	If you change name of any file make sure to paste same name in code to load image or file with same name.

Expectations and Results:
We faced some problem in link listing and in making sure size is same for each smiley. We achieved what as expected a full working game with algorithm link list with help of images and sound clips.
